### Description
__*A website that counts the number of times a word occurs and sorts words in order of popularity.*__

* Let's create a website that lets users input a block of text and returns a list of all the unique words and how many times they appeared.
* If you finish that are you're feeling really comfortable with forEach loops, try to do do the above exercise but order the list by the number of appearances - greatest to least. For words that appear the same amount of times, order by which word appeared first.
